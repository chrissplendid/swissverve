Stocks are typically issued by publicly traded companies, enabling them to raise capital for growth, expansion, and operations. Investors acquire stocks through various channels, including stock exchanges, brokerages, and direct offerings, with each share representing a fractional ownership interest in the underlying corporation.

Common stocks represent the most prevalent form of equity ownership, entitling shareholders to voting rights and dividends based on company performance. Preferred stocks, on the other hand, offer fixed dividend payments and priority claims on assets in the event of liquidation, albeit without voting rights.

These markets operate through a network of exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and various regional exchanges worldwide. Transactions are executed electronically or through intermediaries, with prices determined by supply and demand dynamics, investor sentiment, and fundamental factors such as earnings, dividends, and macroeconomic conditions.
